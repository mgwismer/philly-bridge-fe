                A group of intermediate to advanced players gathers every Saturday morning starting at 10
                AM to play Bridge in a relaxed, social atmosphere. We’ll bring the cards and will be in the back. Partnerships welcome but not required. We will break partnerships up, at least temporarily, if we don’t have a full table to allow everyone a chance to play and to keep wait time to a minimum.
